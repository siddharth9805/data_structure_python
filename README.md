# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Introduction
This project consists of a collection of Python scripts, each implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms. The scripts serve an educational purpose, providing clear examples of how various data structures and algorithms can be implemented in Python. From basic data structures like linked lists, queues, and stacks, to more complex structures such as binary search trees and heaps, as well as algorithms like binary search and recursion-based solutions. This collection is an excellent resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in computer science fundamentals.

## Installation
To use these scripts, you will need Python installed on your system. These scripts are written to be compatible with Python 3. No additional installation steps are required, as they use Python's standard library.

## Usage
Each script can be run independently to demonstrate its corresponding data structure or algorithm. Here are brief descriptions and usage examples for some key scripts:

- **Binary Search Algorithm (`binary_search_algo.py`)**: Implements binary search in a sorted array.
- **Binary Search Tree (`bst.py`)**: Demonstrates operations on a binary search tree, including insertion, search, and traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List (`dll.py`)**: Provides an implementation of a doubly linked list with basic operations like insertion and deletion.
- **Tower of Hanoi (`Hanoi.py`)**: Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.
- **Heap (`heap.py`)**: Implements a min-heap data structure with insertion and removal operations.
- **Linked List (`ll.py`)**: Implements a singly linked list with basic functionalities.
- **Palindrome Detection (`palindrome_recursion.py`)**: Uses recursion to check if a string is a palindrome.
- **Queue (`queue_data_structure.py`)**: Demonstrates queue implementation using Python lists.
- **Stack (`stack.py`)**: Implements a stack with its fundamental operations.
- **Sort (`sort.py`)**: Implements all the imported sorting algorithms.

For detailed usage and examples, refer to the specific sections below.

## Features
This project includes the following data structures and algorithms:
- Binary Search
- Binary Search Tree
- Doubly Linked List
- Tower of Hanoi
- Heap
- Linked List

## Dependencies
These scripts are standalone and require only Python 3.x. They do not depend on external libraries, making use of Python's standard library for demonstration purposes.

## Examples
Below are brief examples of how to use or run some of the scripts:

### Binary Search Algorithm
```python
# Example of using the binary_search_algo.py script
# Assuming a sorted array and a value to search for
sorted_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
value = 3
# The script would then be used to find the index of 'value' in 'sorted_array'
````
## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues running these scripts, ensure you are using Python 3.x. Also, check the script's comments for any specific instructions or requirements.
